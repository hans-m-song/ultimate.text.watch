fuzzy.text.shake
================

my stripped-clean & battery-life-focused fork from fuzzy text int'l (https://github.com/hallettj/Fuzzy-Text-International)

added:
- shake to show detailed time, date, and battery
- midday & midnight time

planned:
- monitor bluetooth connectivity with phone
- current weather condition

removed:
- configurations
- appsync & javascript
- translations (sorry...)
